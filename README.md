# Modless Skids

Replace default skids with custom ones -- compatible with mods.

Can only be used to update skids while in the main menu.

Once you've applied skids, they will be autoloaded the next time TM starts.

This works by replacing the game's references to the standard .dds files for skids with references to custom .dds files for skids.
Thus there's no effect on map mods or time of day.

Skids are sourced from <https://github.com/snixtho/tm2020-skids> but are mirrored to avoid GitHub limitations.
They're also cached so you only need to download them once.

**Note: please do not update this plugin while in a map.**
